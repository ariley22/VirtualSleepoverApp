Currently a 2-player Q&A game for Android, which works at a basic level and allows users to save their answers in a virtual scrapbook.  [See video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5446brsW3eA)

## Basic To-Do List
- Ensure that home screen options respond to the user's status (whether they already have a user connection and/or a game in progress)
- Fix bugs that occur when a user navigates away from the game.
- Add language options to API pull
- Let user select the number of rounds
- Add "Dare" component, which allows photos to be taken and shared, for Truth or Dare game.
